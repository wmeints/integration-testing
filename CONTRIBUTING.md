## How can I contribute?

### Reporting bugs

This section guides you through the process of submitting bugs.
Following these guidelines helps me get a fix out there quickly and easily so
you can keep enjoying the content on the website.

#### Before submitting a bug report

Before submitting a bug, please search the issue list and make sure your problem
wasn't already reported. In case it was reported, please give the bug a +1
to let me know you're experiencing the same problem.

> **NOTE** If you find a **Closed** issue, and you're still experiencing a
> problem, open a new issue and link to the old one. I may have caused a
> regression.

#### How do I submit a good bug report?

For a bug to be easily reproduced and fixed we need a few bits of information:

- Provide a clear, descriptive title.
- Describe what you expected to happen and what actually happened.
- Describe reproduction steps in your issue, what did you that before the bug
  was triggered?
- Did the issue start to happen recently?

### Suggesting enhancements

This section explains how to submit enhancements for the library.
Please follow these guidelines when submitting enhancements:

- Provide a clear, descriptive title for your suggestion.
- Provide a detailed description of the enhancement.
- Explain why this enhancement should be implemented and what benefits it brings.
- Provide the current situation and the expected behavior on the website (if
  applicable).

### Submitting pull requests

When submitting pull requests, make sure you follow these guidelines:

- Include unit-tests with your changes, this makes it easier for us to validate
  your changes.
- Please try to avoid reformatting existing code, we can't review your changes
  when you're including whitespace changes and reformats.
- When using a new library, make sure to mention this in your pull request.
  Also, make sure that the license is compatible with the license that this
  project uses.

We're only merging pull requests that don't have merge conflicts, so if you
encounter a merge conflict, please resolve it first before submitting the pull
request.

## Style guides

To keep the code consistent across several developers we're using
`.editorconfig` files and follow coding guidelines. Please refer to specific
sections below for more information.

### .NET Core Style guide

We're following the
[C# coding guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions)

### Conventional commit messages

To make publishing change logs easier, we're using [conventional commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
